                Varanasi, also known as Kashi or Banaras, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and holds deep spiritual significance in India. Located on the banks of the sacred Ganges River in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi is considered the spiritual capital of India and a major pilgrimage site for Hindus. The city is renowned for its ghats—stone steps leading down to the river—where devotees perform ritual baths, offer prayers, and conduct cremation ceremonies.

                The best time to visit Varanasi is during the winter months, from October to March, when the weather is pleasant and ideal for sightseeing and spiritual exploration. During this period, temperatures range from 5°C to 20°C, making it comfortable to walk through the city's narrow lanes, visit temples, and attend the famous Ganga Aarti at the ghats. This season also hosts several important festivals like Diwali, Dev Deepawali, and Makar Sankranti, which add to the city's vibrant and sacred atmosphere.
